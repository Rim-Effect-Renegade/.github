## Rim-Effect Renegade Edition
This is a fork of the original Rim-Effect tailored to my specific tastes, there's a lot of little changes but the biggest ones you're likely to notice are:
- Biotech is used for races instead of Humanoid Alien Races.
- Asimov is used for the mechs instead of VEF platforms.
- Extra content.

I'd recommend looking at both this and the original, in-game, and give them a trial run, see which version you prefer!

### Issues
You can submit a ticket on any of the mods if you have any issues. Make sure that:
- You are up to date ([cloning the repo using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) is the easiest way, you then just fetch the latest version when you want to update)
- If you are downloading the zip directly and using that make sure to DELETE old versions first! Overwriting isn't enough in the case where a file is removed/renamed and WILL cause problems!
- Provide steps to reproduce it, if I can't then it's much harder for me to even guess how to fix. If it's a random issue that doesn't appear to have steps, it probably does and is just hard to figure out, so try to include as much info as you can if you can't figure out exact steps.
- Include a HugsLib Log using Ctrl + F12 in-Game or clicking the Share button on the log window when it's open, if you can't upload the log, you can always copy to clipboard!

If you're not using HugsLib, then use it, this isn't a debate, you either use it or you do not get help as I CAN'T without it in most cases.

Ideally you can save us both a lot of time if you:
- Check you can reproduce the issue in a minimal list, this will hopefully rule out conflicts.
- If it IS a conflict, narrow down what mod it is happening with.

Odds are that if it's a conflict, only you will be able to find it, I do not have the time to test every mod in everyones mod list that has an issue to find it, and for all we know it could be an outdated version of that mod that's causing the problem and would be impossible for me to find. The best way to deal with this is a binary search, which is loading up with half your mods enabled, if it's still breaking then the conflict is still loaded, and you just repeat until you narrow it down, at most this should only take a handful of tries. It's best to use an external mod manager like RimPy or RimSort so you can save/load your original list easily.

### Got a fix yourself?
In the rare occurrence that you have a fix you want to contribute you are absolutely welcome to do so with a pull request.

### Looking for the original Humanoid Alien Races based Rim-Effect?
You can find it right here!
- [Rim-Effect: Legacy](https://github.com/Rim-Effect-Legacy) - Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 based original, unchanged and maintained as is.

### Where can you find news about the Rim-Effect mods?
All Rim-Effect information I post will be done via entirely free posts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/neronix17), as I am just maintaining I do not feel it would be right to paywall those posts.
